- ✅ Created comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude generated data
- ✅ Updated `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies
- ✅ Organized essential files for deployment

### 2. **GitHub Repository Setup**
- ✅ Successfully uploaded to [https://github.com/ananya15082002/RCA_Agent](https://github.com/ananya15082002/RCA_Agent)
- ✅ All essential files committed and pushed
- ✅ Repository is ready for AWS deployment

### 3. **AWS Deployment Preparation**
- ✅ Created comprehensive deployment guides:
  - `AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed deployment guide
  - `AWS_TERMINAL_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step AWS CLI commands
  - `deploy.sh` - Automated deployment script
- ✅ All scripts are executable and ready for use

## 🚀 Next Steps for AWS Deployment

### **Option 1: Quick Deployment (Recommended)**
1. **Launch EC2 Instance** using the AWS CLI commands in `AWS_TERMINAL_GUIDE.md`
2. **Run the deployment script**: `./deploy.sh`
3. **Access your application** at the provided URLs

### **Option 2: Manual Deployment**
1. Follow the detailed guide in `AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. Execute each step manually for more control
3. Configure services and SSL as needed

## 🌐 Expected Access URLs

After deployment, your system will be accessible at:
- **RCA Portal**: `http://YOUR_EC2_PUBLIC_IP:8501`
- **Error Dashboard**: `http://YOUR_EC2_PUBLIC_IP:8502`

## 🔧 Required Configuration

Before the system is fully functional, you'll need to update:

1. **CubeAPM Configuration** in `rca_pipeline.py`
2. **Google Chat Webhook URL** for alerts
3. **Environment-specific URLs** and endpoints
4. **Security credentials** and API keys

## 📊 System Features

Your deployed system will include:

- ✅ **Real-time 5xx error monitoring** across 25 UNSET environment services
- ✅ **AI-powered RCA analysis** with detailed reports
- ✅ **Web-based dashboards** for error analytics
- ✅ **Google Chat integration** for alerts
- ✅ **Automatic data cleanup** and management
- ✅ **24/7 monitoring** with auto-restart capabilities

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### **If you encounter issues:**

1. **Check the logs**: `tail -f logs/rca_pipeline.log`
2. **Verify services**: `sudo systemctl status`
3. **Review AWS security groups** for port access
4. **Check the deployment guides** for troubleshooting steps

### **Useful Commands:**
```bash
# Check system status
./status_streamlit.sh

# View logs
tail -f logs/rca_pipeline.log
tail -f logs/streamlit_portal.log
tail -f logs/error_dashboard.log

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart rca-pipeline streamlit-portal error-dashboard
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ EC2 instance is running and accessible
- ✅ All three services are running (rca-pipeline, streamlit-portal, error-dashboard)
- ✅ Ports 8501 and 8502 are accessible from the internet
- ✅ Web interfaces load without errors
- ✅ Configuration is updated with your specific endpoints

## 📞 Getting Help

If you need assistance:
1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Review the deployment guides
3. Verify AWS security group configurations
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
